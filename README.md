# White Knuckle Multi Player Mod - White Knuckle Online MOD

**[中文](README_CN.md)** | **English**

## Overview

This is a Unity MOD for the game  *White Knuckle* , implementing basic networked player mapping (currently only maps grabbable player capsules).

 **Important Disclaimer** :

* **I am not a Unity/C# developer by profession.**
* **Some code in this project is AI-generated.**
* Consequently,  **the quality of much of the code is likely very poor** . Please use with caution.
* The online multiplayer functionality code is  **forked from a previous online mod project** .

**Known Issues:**

* Chaotic object lifecycle management, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

**Potential Future Goals:**

## Installation

Download the required `.dll` files from the [Releases](https://github.com/Shen-X-L/WKMultiMod/releases) page and place them into the `BepInEx/plugins` directory within your game folder.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Game** : *White Knuckle b-0.52a*
2. **Framework** : [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) (Use a version compatible with your game version)

### Installation Steps

**bash**

```
# 1. Clone this repository locally
git clone https://github.com/Shen-X-L/WKMultiMod.git

# 2. Build the MOD
# Method A: Open and build WhiteKnuckleMod.sln in Visual Studio
# Method B: Use the command line
dotnet build -c Release
```

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the built `WhiteKnuckleMod.dll` file into your game directory's `BepInEx\plugins\` folder.
2. Copy the dependency `LiteNetLib.dll` file to the same `BepInEx\plugins\` folder.
3. Launch the game and check the BepInEx console or log files to confirm the MOD loaded successfully.

## Development Guide

### Environment Setup

1. **Install .NET SDK** : Download and install from the [Microsoft .NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/).
2. **Restore NuGet Packages** : Run `dotnet restore` in the project root directory.
3. **Obtain Game DLLs** : It is essential to follow the instructions in `lib/README.md` to acquire the necessary game DLL files and place them in the `lib/` directory.

### Dependency Notes

Compiling this project requires referencing some DLL files from the game itself ( **these files are copyrighted and must NOT be committed to this repository** ), primarily including:

* `Assembly-CSharp.dll`
* `UnityEngine.dll`
* `UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll`
* etc. (See `lib/README.md` for details).

### Key Build Configuration

The project file (`WhiteKnuckleMod.csproj`) is configured with key references and build targets, ensuring `TargetFramework` is set to `netstandard2.1` and allowing unsafe code.
